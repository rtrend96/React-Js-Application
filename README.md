for crating this project i execute a command 
## npm install g create-react-app 

then 

## create-react-app rushi_app

in this all files are in src folder 

after that in project i created 4 component <Header.js> , <Footer.js> , <Main.js>, <Nav.js> and those css files

after creating all components i import them to all in app.js file to execute them.
In Main.js i created 3 blog post having Title, date , image and the information and all the titles refer to main blog website while clicking on them.

In Nav.js 
I used axios function to execute the API keys. 
I use google API to get the title of the news. 
API key is :0f6523556e4047888de4267e4d626754
Using AJAX use timer to them refresh.
Also add the 5 sec timer to refresh the page in nav.js file.
